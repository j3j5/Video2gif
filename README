This is a simple CodeIgniter app that allows you to pick a youtube video and get a GIF out of it.

You can select at what time you want the gif to start and how many seconds of the video you want.

The code for the youtube grabber class is taken from http://1chris.com/post/39/using-php-to-download-youtube-flvs/
